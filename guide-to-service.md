			<p style="text-align: left;">Henry was very interested in getting a job, he talked about working a couple shifts every week but knew that he required help getting a job. He thought about talking to his <strong>social worker at CLBC.</strong> He expressed his interest in working on his employment goal. His social worker referred him to the <strong>Employment Service, BEST at BACI.</strong></p>

			<h4 style="text-align:center;">2</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Once BEST received his referral, <strong>within a week an Employment Specialist (ES)</strong> from BEST contacted Henry and scheduled an <strong>informational meeting.</strong> The ES invited Henry to bring along his <strong>parents, caregiver or people who he thought would help him with attaining his employment goal.</strong> </p>

				<p style="text-align: left;">On the scheduled day, Henry went to the BEST office with his mom and brother. He was greeted by an ES. They introduced themselves and the ES talked to Henry about his employment goal, his dream job, what he would like to do, and why is working important to him. Next the ES introduced the service, how the process would role out, and how the meetings would be structured. The ES gave them relevant documents and answered any questions and concerns they had. The ES encouraged them to review the information and  <strong>get back to BEST within a week.</strong></p>

			<p style="text-align: left;">Henry came to the intake meeting with his ES. He was very excited and eager to start. Together they completed some essential paper work and set up three regular weekly appointments. Then they were ready to go.</p>

			<h4 style="text-align:center;">6</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Henry was back the following week for his appointment with his ES. They first created a plan and projected a timeline by using a planning sheet. The first step here was to start the <strong>"DSCOVERY PROCESS"</strong> and specifically start the <strong>"PRIMARY DISCOVERY"</strong>. The objective of the primary discovery is to be able to identify areas where Henry may require some additional support. For example interview skills, computer skills etc. Workshops have been created to provide additional support.</p>

			<h4 style="text-align:center;">7</h4>
			<p style="text-align: left;">Once the Primary Discovery is completed, Henry would move on to the <strong>"SECONDARY DISCOVERY"</strong> which is more focused on discovering work preferences related to skills, interest, environment, values, learning style, etc. Tools and resources have been created to supplement the discovery process.</p>

			<p style="text-align: left;">On the basis of the discovery process, the ES and Henry will be able to narrow down the <strong>ICE (IDEAL CONDITIONS of EMPLOYMENT and DISCOVERY SUMMARY).</strong> Basically discover where Henry would like to work.</p>

				<h4 style="text-align:center;">9</h4>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Once Henry's work preferences have been identified and his skills have been assessed, his ES will start with the <strong>"Job Development"</strong> and <strong>"Job Search"</strong>. Henry and his ES together will start creating resumes with updated information and applying for jobs that are of interest to Henry and also are a good fit for his skills and abilities. His ES will also start <strong>connecting and developing relationships with employers</strong> who have an opening and requirement which would be a right fit for the skill set Henry possesses. His ES will help Henry in identifying and creating opportunities as well as setting up meetings with employers. This would <strong>result in obtaining employment opportunities for Henry</strong>.</p>

				<h4 style="text-align:center;">10</h4>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Once Henry has successfully obtained a paid position according to the <strong>Employment Standard Act</strong>, he will be supported through his hiring procedure and then his ES will support him in understanding the job, doing a task-analysis, help with <strong>job coaching</strong> as well as in understanding and adapting to the work culture. If required his ES will also help train him to get to the job, taking appropriate breaks, and communicating with his supervisor and peers. Once Henry and his employers have established a good working relationship, the ES will slowly start fading out and replace themselves with natural supports. A maintenance plan would be put in place and Henry would be <strong>monitored for at least 3 years</strong>.</p>
